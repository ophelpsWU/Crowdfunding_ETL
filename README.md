To start, run the ETL_Mini_Project... Jupyter Notebook all the way through.
Next, run the crowdfunding_db_schema.sql (in the Resources folder) in pgAdmin to create the tables.
Import the csv documents in the Resources folder (into the tables with names matching the csv name) in the order they are created in the schema (category > subcategory > contacts > campaign). Make sure to select the Header toggle on the Options tab of the Import window.
Finally, run the select statments in crowdfunding_db_schema.sql (in the Resources folder) one at a time to verify the data.
